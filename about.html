    <h1>About </h1>
    <p style="font: size 100px;;">As one of the first restaurants  famed Restaurant Row in the West Loop, Stephanie Izard’s
        Fooddddie began in 2010 with a goal of serving bold, global flavors to our local community (and visitors!). Since then, our desire to treat guests like family has remained the same (as have our Green Beans) – 
        but our seasonal flavors, cocktails, wine and locally-rooted beer are ever-changing..</p>
    <p>In many popular restaurants, waiters/waitresses tend to miss out on  tables  or  customers’  calls  during  busy  hours  potentially  decreasing  ones clientele.  While  this  is  an  ongoing  issue,  there  is  still  no  product  that drastically  improves  the  communication  between  the  servers  and  the customers  in  the  current  market.  Hence,  the  goal  is  to  design  a  system  in which  the  customers  can  call  their  servers  easily  
        and  help  the  restaurant increase overall efficiency. </p>
